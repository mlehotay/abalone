### Project 3

Create a **small** Flask App that captures user input and generates a prediction.



**TASK**

1. Choose from the following three datasets:

- A - [Used Cars](https://www.kaggle.com/avikasliwal/used-cars-price-prediction#train-data.csv) ~ Predict Price (convert to CAD)
- B - [Abalone](https://www.kaggle.com/rodolfomendes/abalone-dataset) ~ Predict Age (Rings)
- C - [Tips](https://www.kaggle.com/jsphyg/tipping) ~ Predict Tip ($)

2. Build a model on top of this data
3. Save the model ðŸ¥’
4. Wrap your saved model in a small Flask wrapper
5. Have users input different X values to generate new predictions



**RUBRIC**

Your project (model and Flask App) must:

- establish a benchmark and a naive model

- use a `LinearRegression`, 1 of `Lasso`/`Ridge`/`ElasticNet`, and 1 CatBoostRegressor/XGBoostRegressor
- have evidence of grid searching
- use `sklearn.pipeline`
- accept user input and be able to generate new predictions on the fly
- use a 3rd-party python library/package that we haven't discussed.



**OPTIONAL**

If you've crushed the required bits with time to spare:

- add a more *pretty* interface to your model/flask app using HTML/CSS
- host the app on heroku (or something similar)
